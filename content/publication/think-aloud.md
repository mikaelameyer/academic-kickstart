abstract = "We describe think-aloud interviews with students as a powerful tool to ensure that draft questions fulfill their intended purpose, uncover unexpected misconceptions or surprising readings of questions, and suggest new questions or further pedagogical research. We have conducted more than 40 hour-long think-aloud interviews to develop over 50 assessment questions, and have collected pre- and post-test assessment data from hundreds of introductory statistics students at two institutions."
