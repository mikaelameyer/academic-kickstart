abstract = "Think-aloud interviews with students can be used to detect specific misconceptions and understand how students reason about statistical questions. Data from think-aloud interviews can then be used to develop conceptual assessments, design new teaching strategies, or suggest further experiments to learn how students think about statistics. In this webinar, we will discuss the benefits of using think-aloud interviews to develop conceptual assessments and the experience we have had using think-aloud interviews in two introductory-level statistics courses."

abstract = "We estimate the associations between the events of 2020 and changes in five FBI Part 1 crime rates in that year. We find that these crime rates do not change consistently for each crime type; for example, homicide rates increased in 2020 compared to the two previous years, while larcenies increased."
